                    <p class="paragraph">Akira Nakai was born in Chiba, Japan, on October 15, 1970. From a young age, he developed an unwavering passion for cars, constantly immersing himself in automotive culture. Nakai-San’s fascination with Porsches began in the late 1980s when he saw a Porsche 930 Turbo on the streets of Japan. The vehicle’s sleek lines and raw power left an indelible mark on his mind, igniting a lifelong love affair with the German marque.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">In 1997, Nakai-San established his custom car shop, Rauh Welt Begriff, which translates to “Rough World Concept.” With RWB, Nakai-San sought to push the boundaries of Porsche customisation, blending aggressive aesthetics with track-ready performance. His unique vision focused on widening the bodywork, adding distinctive over fenders, and enhancing aerodynamics to create a truly unique driving experience.</p>

                    <h2>TUNNING CONCEPT</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">What sets Nakai-San’s work apart is his unwavering commitment to preserving the soul and character of each Porsche he transforms. His designs are a harmonious blend of form and function, drawing inspiration from classic racing cars and fusing them with a modern, aggressive edge. The wide-body conversions, the iconic riveted fender flares, and the oversized rear wings all contribute to RWB Porsches’ unmistakable aesthetic.</p>
